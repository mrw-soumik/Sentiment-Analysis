# Sentiment Analysis Tool

**Technologies:** Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn  

## Objective
This project builds a sentiment analysis tool that classifies text as positive, negative, or neutral, which can be useful for analyzing opinions in social media, reviews, and other text sources.

## Key Contributions
- Preprocessed data using tokenization, stemming, and removal of stopwords.
- Built a Naive Bayes classifier using Scikit-learn to predict sentiment based on labeled text data.
- Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance to assess its effectiveness in sentiment classification.

## Outcome
The sentiment analysis tool accurately classifies sentiments for text data, showcasing practical applications in opinion mining.
